## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using semantic HTML tags, descriptive CSS classes naming.

```html
<section class="card">
  <img class="image" />
  <h1 class="heading">...</h1>
  <p class="description">...</p>
</section>
```

### Continued development

Working on pure HTML/CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Setting width and height on `<img />` tag](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/setting-height-width-images-important-again/) - setting width and height attributes on your images can prevent layout shifts and improve the experience of your site visitors.
